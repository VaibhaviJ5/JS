<!-- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web
 development to create asynchronous web applications. It allows web
  pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with 
  the server behind the scenes, without reloading the entire page. This can improve 
  user experience by making web applications faster and more responsive.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how AJAX works with examples: -->

<!-- AJAX with fetch

<!-- Summary
XMLHttpRequest: The older, more complex way to make AJAX requests.
fetch: A modern, simpler API for making HTTP requests.
Both methods can handle asynchronous requests to fetch or send data to a server, but fetch is generally preferred due 
to its cleaner syntax and built-in support for promises. -->
