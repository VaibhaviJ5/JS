<!-- Definition of BOM
The BOM provides objects and methods that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser window and
 its components. While the DOM focuses on manipulating
 the content of web pages, the BOM deals with the browser window itself and its elements. -->

The BOM is a useful part of web development that allows JavaScript to interact with
 various aspects of the browser and its environment. While the DOM focuses on the content of the page,
  the BOM provides a way to interact with the browser itself,
 enabling functionalities such as storage, navigation, and user interaction dialogs. -->
