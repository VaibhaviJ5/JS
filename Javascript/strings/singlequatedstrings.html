     <!-- a string is a data type used to represent text.
     Strings are sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`). 
     They can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. -->

     
    <!-- Single Quotes ('): Encloses the string in single quotes.
    Double Quotes ("): Encloses the string in double quotes.
    Backticks (`): Encloses the string in backticks, allowing for multi-line strings and embedded expressions. -->

    <script>
    



    // Single Quotes ('):

    let singleQuoteString = 'Hello, World!';  
    document.write(singleQuoteString);



    // Example 2: String Containing Single Quotes
    // Using single quotes inside a single-quoted string by escaping them with a backslash.


        let quote = 'It\'s a beautiful day!';
        document.write(quote);  


        // Output: It's a beautiful day!

// In this example, the string contains an apostrophe ('), which is also a single quote. To include this
//  character within the string itself, you escape it using a backslash (\'). 
// This allows the string to include the single quote without ending the string prematurely.
