    // Using Double Quotes Inside Double Quotes (Escaping)

    // To include double quotes within a string that is also enclosed in double quotes, 
    // you need to escape them with a backslash (\).

        let dialogue = "He said, \"Hello, how are you?\"";
        document.write(dialogue + "<br>"); 
        // Output: He said, "Hello, how are you?"


        // Concatenation with Double Quotes
        // You can concatenate strings using the + operator, even if they are enclosed in double quotes.
        let firstPart = "Hello";
        let secondPart = "World";
        let combined = firstPart + " " + secondPart + "!";
        console.log(combined + "<br>"); 
        
        // Output: Hello World!


        // Multiline Strings
        //     Double quotes do not support multiline strings directly.
        //     For multiline text, you would typically use backticks (template literals).
        //     However, you can still manually concatenate strings to achieve multiline effects.

        let multiline = "This is line 1.\n" +
                "This is line 2.\n" +
                "This is line 3.";
             document.write(multiline + "<br>");

// Output:
// This is line 1.
// This is line 2.
// This is line 3.


// Escaping Double Quotes Inside Double Quotes
// In a more complex example, you might need to escape double quotes for special cases:


        let escapedQuotes = "She said, \"He said, \\\"Hello!\\\"\"";
        document.write(escapedQuotes + "<br>");
// Output: She said, "He said, \"Hello!\""


// Including Special Characters
// Double quotes can also be used to include special characters in a string.

let specialChars = "Line1\nLine2\tTabbed";
document.write(specialChars + "<br>");


// Output:
// Line1
// Line2   Tabbed
