<!-- In JavaScript, "quantifiers" typically refer to mechanisms for specifying the quantity or frequency of operations, particularly in the context of regular expressions and loops. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how quantifiers are used in these contexts:

1. Regular Expression Quantifiers
In regular expressions, quantifiers specify how often an element in the pattern should occur. Here are the common quantifiers:

* (Asterisk): Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Example: /a*/ matches "", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.

+ (Plus): Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Example: /a+/ matches "a", "aa", "aaa", etc., but not ""

? (Question Mark): Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element.
Example: /a?/ matches "", "a", but not "aa"

{n} (Curly Braces with a Number): Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.
Example: /a{3}/ matches "aaa" but not "aa" or "aaaa"

{n,} (Curly Braces with a Minimum Number): Matches n or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Example: /a{2,}/ matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", etc.

{n,m} (Curly Braces with a Range): Matches between n and m occurrences of the preceding element.
Example: /a{2,4}/ matches "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", but not "a" or "aaaaa"

*?, +?, ??, {n,m}?: These are "lazy" or "non-greedy" versions of the quantifiers. They match as few characters as possible.
Example: /<.*?>/ matches "<>", "<a>", but not "<aaaaa>" -->
