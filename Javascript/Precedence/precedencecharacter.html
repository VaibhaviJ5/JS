<!-- In JavaScript, the term "precedence" often refers to "operator precedence," 
which determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. However, you might also be referring to "precedence characters"
 in the context of specific JavaScript functionalities,
 such as regular expressions or special syntax. Here's an overview of operator precedence and some related concepts:

1. Operator Precedence
Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed relative to each other in expressions. 
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.

Here’s a brief overview of some operators and their precedence:

Highest Precedence

() (Grouping): Controls the order of evaluation.
. (Member Access): Accesses properties of an object.
[] (Array Indexing): Accesses elements of an array.
++, -- (Increment/Decrement): Can be prefix or postfix.
Multiplication and Division

* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulo)
Addition and Subtraction

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
Relational Operators

<, <=, >, >= (Less than, Less than or equal to, Greater than, Greater than or equal to)
Equality Operators

==, === (Equal, Strict equal)
!=, !== (Not equal, Strict not equal)
Logical Operators

&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
Assignment Operators

= (Assignment)
+=, -=, *=, /=, %= (Compound assignment)
Lowest Precedence

, (Comma): Separates expressions in sequences.
Example
In the expression 3 + 4 * 2, multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so the result is calculated
 as 3 + (4 * 2) which evaluates to 11.


const result = 3 + 4 * 2; // Evaluates to 11
2. Regular Expression Precedence
In regular expressions, you might deal with precedence when combining different types of patterns. The order of 
evaluation is determined by the regular expression syntax and operators.

Example
In the pattern /a+b*/, the + (one or more occurrences) has higher precedence than * (zero or more occurrences),
 so it matches one or more a followed by zero or more b.


const regex = /a+b*/;
const str = "aaabb";
console.log(str.match(regex)); // Output: ["aaabb"]
3. Special Characters
Some special characters or symbols in JavaScript have precedence or specific roles in certain contexts:

(): Used to group expressions and control the order of operations.
[]: Used for array indexing.
{}: Used to define code blocks or object literals.
Summary
Operator Precedence: Determines the order of evaluation in expressions.
Regular Expressions: Involve precedence of pattern operators to match text.
Special Characters: Used for grouping, indexing, or defining blocks.
Understanding precedence helps in writing correct and predictable JavaScript code,
 ensuring that expressions evaluate in the intended order. -->
